#TableName: 
#    Make sure to specify the catalog name and table name, enclosed in square brackets appropriately

#    This specifies any filtering that should be applied when selecting rows to insert.  Use "S" as
#    a prefix for the source table, and D as a prefix for the destination table
#JoinClause
#    Currently unused.  This would specify a join clause for the tables, if something other than the 
#    primary key should be used for matching.
